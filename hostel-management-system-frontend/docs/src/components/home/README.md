# Home Components (`/src/components/home`)

This directory contains components primarily used for the application's main landing or home page, potentially for unauthenticated users or as a general entry point.

## Component Overview

- **[`ModernHeader.jsx`](./ModernHeader.md)**

  - **Summary:** Likely renders a large, visually appealing header section for the home page, possibly including navigation, calls to action, or background images/effects.
  - _Future File:_ `./ModernHeader.md`

- **[`StatisticsGraphic.jsx`](./StatisticsGraphic.md)**
  - **Summary:** Renders a section displaying key statistics or graphics relevant to the application, possibly in an animated or visually engaging way for the home page.
