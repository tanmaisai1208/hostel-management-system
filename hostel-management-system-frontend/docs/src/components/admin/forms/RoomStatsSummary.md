# Room Statistics Summary Component (`/src/components/admin/forms/RoomStatsSummary.jsx`)

This component is responsible for displaying a statistical summary derived from an array of room data, typically generated by either form input or a parsed CSV file in the parent form (`RoomOnlyForm` or `UnitBasedForm`).

## Purpose and Functionality

Given an array of room objects and a flag indicating the hostel structure type, this component calculates and presents various statistics about the rooms, floors, and (if applicable) units.

## Props

- `data` (Array): An array of room objects. Each object should contain:
  - `capacity` (Number/String): The capacity of the room.
  - `status` (String, optional): The status of the room (e.g., "Active", "Inactive"). Used to count active/inactive rooms.
  - `roomNumber` (Number/String, used if `!isUnitBased`): The room number, from which the floor number is derived (e.g., room 101 is on floor 1).
  - `unitNumber` (Number/String, used if `isUnitBased`): The unit number, from which the floor number is derived (e.g., unit 101 is on floor 1).
- `isUnitBased` (Boolean): A flag indicating the type of hostel configuration:
  - `true`: Unit-based structure. Floor numbers are derived from `unitNumber`, and unit-specific calculations (like exceptions) are performed.
  - `false`: Room-only structure. Floor numbers are derived from `roomNumber`.

## Calculations Performed

- **Overall:** Total number of rooms, total capacity (sum of all room capacities), count of active rooms, count of inactive rooms.
- **Per Floor:** For each floor identified:
  - Total number of rooms on the floor.
  - Total capacity of the floor.
  - If `isUnitBased`, the number of unique units on the floor.
- **Unit Exceptions (Only if `isUnitBased`):**
  - Counts the number of rooms within each unit.
  - Determines the most frequent room count across all units (considered the "standard" count).
  - Identifies units whose room count differs from the standard count.

## Display

- Renders the overall statistics (Total Rooms, Total Capacity, Active Rooms, Inactive Rooms) in separate styled boxes.
- Displays a list summarizing the statistics for each floor, sorted by floor number.
- If `isUnitBased` and unit exceptions were found, it displays a list of these exceptional units along with their specific room counts.

## Dependencies

- `react`
